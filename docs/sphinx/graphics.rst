Rendering Graphics
==================

Libobs has a custom-made programmable graphics subsystem that wraps both
Direct3D 11 and OpenGL.  The reason why it was designed with a custom
graphics subsystem was to accommodate custom capture features only
available on specific operating systems.

(Author's note: In retrospect, I probably should have used something
like ANGLE, but I would have to had modified it to accommodate my
specific use-cases.)
